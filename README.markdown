# Docker RSyslog with RELP module support (https://github.com/gynter/docker-rsyslog-relp)

A generic Docker image for [RSyslog](https://www.rsyslog.com/) with [RELP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliable_Event_Logging_Protocol)
module support . This image is designed to run securely on non-systemd (i.e Alpine) containers as unprivileged user (UID/GID 1000)

See https://github.com/gynter/rsyslog-docker-compose-example for deployment example using Docker Compose.

## Important files and directories

- `/etc/rsyslog.conf` - Main rsyslogd configuration file, can be overwritten by a bind mount;
- `/etc/rsyslog.d/` - Extra rsyslogd configuration files, can be mounted as a volume. Files must have `*.conf` extension
  to be loaded by rsyslogd;
- `/srv/rsyslog/` - rsyslogd working directory, PID file will be also created there. It's recommended to mount this
  directory as a volume if there's a need to persist working files (i.e when using queue files to store data on file
  system);
- `/logs/` - A directory for storing log files. Should be mounted as a volume.
- `/etc/pki/rsyslog/` - PKI files (CA certificate, server certificate and key) for rsyslogd. Must be mounted as a
   volume or bind mount. File names are defined in `13-listen-relp-tls.conf` as follows:
     - `ca.pem` - PEM format x509 root or intermediate CA from which TLS certs are issued from;
     - `cert.pem` - PEM format x509 certificate for server;
     - `key.pem` - Private key corresponding to server certificate.

## Environment variables

- `RSYSLOG_TLS_PERMITTED_PEER` - List of permitted peer's as defined in [TLS.PermittedPeer](https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/v8-stable/configuration/modules/imrelp.html#tls-permittedpeer).
  Domain names must correspond to x509 certificate SAN extension DNS Name value.

## Known issues

It's not possible to use list format `["peer1_name", "peer2_name"]` for `RSYSLOG_TLS_PERMITTED_PEER`. It might be
due to rsyslogd-s failure to expand environment variables correctly if those contain special characters. This needs
further analysis.
